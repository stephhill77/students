- Major: Computer Science

I started college at Texas A&M studying nuclear engineering, but decided to transfer to computer science here after not feeling fulfilled in my major.

My main hobby is playing video games, and I also enjoy editing clips and videos of moments my friends and I playing together. I keep up a (REALLY) small [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcIFgeV4PP3idB9EqIGQoNA)

I've had experience in:
- C++
- Python
- JavaScript (node.js)
- html
