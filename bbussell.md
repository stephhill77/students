**UT netid:** bbussell

**Github Username:** [BSBussell](https://github.com/BSBussell)

**Major:** Computer Science

**Background:** I grew up playing video games and learned to program by creating my own games on my calculator. I have always been the person who likes taking things apart and figuring out how they work so that's what I do with my games. There are very few electronics I own that I haven't taken apart and put back together in an effort to make it better in some way. It's kind of just what I do.

**Interests:** Aside from just the boring CS stuff I genuinely love video games. I have a lot of fun playing them competitively as well. I participate in Super Smash Brother's tournaments in the local area and whenever I'm not doing that I'll be playing single players games.

**Proficiencies:**
* C/C++
* Git
* Make
* Lua
* Python
* Godot
* Bash/Zsh
