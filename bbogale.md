## Background
Hello everyone, my name is Befikir, people usually call me B. One of my favourite hobbies is either tinkering with computers
or modifying them such that they are asthetically pleasing. I hope to pursure a career that focues on programming machines.
I find industrial machines particularly interesting and would love to be one of the many people developing software for them.

## Interests
As stated before, i would love develop software for industrial machines. Let me expand on why i find that so enthralling.
I once saw a robotic arm build the frame of a car entirely autonomously in high school. The experience has captured my thoughts ever
since. I often find myself imagining programming an abstract machine that could could do any general task asked of it. From building an
entire car by itself to an army of its copies constructing mega structures from a simple command. I realize this is in the realm of science 
fiction at this point in time, but the very idea of its possibility is delightful to me. I would love to be on the front lines on the developments
of these general purpose machines.

## Hobbies
Music is one of my highlights in life. I love to spend time finding new catchy tunes to addict myself to for a week. A list of my current top five
favourite artists is as follows.

1. Neovaii
2. Marina And The Diamonds
3. Eminem
4. Cigarettes After Sex
5. Of Monsters and Men


On the other hand, one of my favourite hobbies is reading fanfictions of my most beloved stories. I enjoy how people manipulate
the source material and add their own twist to them. Weirdly enough, i enjoy when fanfictions add a very dark twists to otherwise
tender stories and vise versa. If you ever find yourself curious how a certain story might have gone or how others have interpreted them
