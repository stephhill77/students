### Background
I once was a very ill boy, back when I could fit in the **palm of my father's hand**.
The only thing that would make me feel any better, was playing Fortnight and Minecraft.
As I would game, I would gain superb abilities, such as building forts and cultivating farms.
  
But, the one thing I was never able to master was communicating with others, so naturally I chose computer 
science as my major. I personally dislike **Alan Turing** and am ready to face the divine consequences 
of me saying so.

### Interests
I love public embarassement and cringe. It is quite the entertainment nowadays. I also like to imagine
very incredibly odd scenarios, that defy all logic and science, happening before my very eyes. I shall 
not go into detail.
