# Background/Interests

Hello, my name is Andrew, and I am a junior majoring in Computer Science. This past summer, I started a software engineering internship, and I will continue with that throughout this semester. I've been programming since early high school, but only was only recently introduced to software engineering topics, and I have learned I enjoy them very much.  

In my spare time, I spend a lot of time outdoors. I also love working on spreadsheets. I use them in every facet of life that I can, and spend a good portion of my free time creating and maintaining them. Google has an excellent [cloud-based JavaScript platform](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) that lets you interface directly with the spreadsheet and add a **ton** of extra functionality.

# Experience

* C++
* Python
* JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, HTML
* C#
* React

* Git
* SQL and NoSQL Databases
