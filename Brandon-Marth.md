### Background

I'm a Junior at the University of Tennessee and I lived near Knoxville all my life. My first experience with programming came in high school in the form of JavaScript. That experience made me decide to major in something programming related.

### Intersts

Some of my interests in my free time are playing a variety of different video games. I also enjoy watching and keeping up with sports, but not really playing them(I'm a comp sci major, so obviously, I am not athletic).
