Hey everyone! My name is Sarah Huang, and I am a junior majoring in computer science. 

### _Origin Story_
I first got into coding because I wanted to create video games when I was a kid. 
Then, I followed the natural progression of taking CS courses in high school (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python) and became a CS major in college. 
Honestly, I could program in these languages again but C++ and now Java are my bread-and-butter because I've recently used them.
I guess I kinda accomplished my childhood dream because I did make a few (very small) games in high school.
You can play my magnum opus [Dungeon Dweller](https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/28303).

### _Interests_
I am the Vice President of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers.
I also work at the Kao Innovation and Collaboration Studio as a student consultant and PR person.
When I'm not dying from my extracurriculars, I enjoy watching anime and playing gacha games.
Below are the gacha games that have taken my soul:
* [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/)
* [Fate/Grand Order](https://fate-go.us/)
* [Twisted Wonderland](https://disneytwistedwonderland.com/)

I am pretty familiar with C++ and vim from taking CS courses at UTK.

I am now familiar in these things because of my summer internship at JTV doing QA test automation:
* Java
* IntelliJ
* Maven
* Git
* Cucumber
* TestNG
* Selenium and Appium
* SQL
* Visual testing tools like Applitools and Percy
