I am a junior computer science major from Knoxville, TN. Over the years I have taken many Computer Science classes from Web Design to the courses at UT.
I have an interest in anything related to computers, from programming to cybersecurity to machine learning.
In my free time I like to practice my coding on [leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com).
