I'm Tyler Nitzsche, a junior majoring in computer science and minoring in chinese. My primary focus is on machine learning, my current experience in machine learning is 
where during my internship at ORNL I created a NLP based research assistant which could read research paper abstracts and make predictions if they were in a specified
category within the Arxiv tags and also predict whether the user would be interested in the paper based on their past papers which they have marked as interested. 
Beyond my academic interests I tend to find interest in pretty much anything that might fall under the category of "Nerdy", video games, card games, board games, books,
shows, movies, whatever, if it's nerdy I've probably at least heard of it.
