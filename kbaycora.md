### **About Me**
I'm here at UT, majoring in computer science. I've also spent many years of my life working at my family's mechanic shop.  
As for my free time, theres a lot of rabbit holes I can get lost in. But to stick with 3: I enjoy taking pictures, playing around within Adobe's suite of stuff & am trying to learn how to be a better cook. [And if interested, are some photos from last summer in Turkey.](https://kamilbaycora.myportfolio.com/summer-21)
