### Background
I am originally from Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Both of my parents and both of my brothers went to The University of Tennesse, Knoxville, so it was a pretty easy choice for me when choosing where to go for college. This summer, I completed my first software engineering internship with Trimble, and I am now beginning my junior year.

### Interests
I am a big sports guy. I love soccer, and my favorite soccer team is [Manchester United](https://www.manutd.com/). I also enjoy watching Formula One Racing and cheering on [McLaren](https://www.mclaren.com/racing/). Additionally, I have recently been focusing on golf and table tennis. In regards to programming, I am interested in machine learning and mobile development.
