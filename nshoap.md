## Background and Interests
Hi, I am Noah Shoap.  I am a junior at UTK and just finished my first internship this summer at [OSIsoft](https://www.osisoft.com/); I learned a lot about the software development process and look forward to learning more in this class.

My interests are pretty varied; I like to learn more about programming, play games, and also am a big fan of football.  My favorite teams are the Cleveland Browns and the Vols.
