## Background & Interests

I am a senior at UTK, and I have little experience outside of classes. I have worked with Github before with my senior design project, but not as much otherwise. Our Senior design project was the ALPS project partnered with the CURENT Organization at EECS, where we looked at Automated Demand Response within Smart Home applications. I currently work with **[Omega Digital Solutions](https://omegadigital.us/)** where we provide backend business automation to local businesses in Maryville.

I lie more on the hardware side of computer engineering, so a lot of my interests involve the parts that go into computers. I built my own PC at 16, and have been tinkering with it ever since. Other than that, I enjoy playing videogames such as CS:GO, Valorant, Destiny 2, and many others.
