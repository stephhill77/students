## Background:
  I grew up about 30 minutes from Knoxville and have been interested in computer science for a long time. I have had 2 internships in web development, but I didn't really enjoy it very much. Luckily, I started learning about machine learning (ML) and that has become my focus within the field. I currently do ML research for UTK with TENNLab and Dr. Plank, Dr. Rose, and Dr. Schuman, and it's been a blast!

## Interests
  As mentioned, I have a big passion for ML, and hope to have a career that allows me to focus on it. I spend a lot of my free time reading poker books and heading to Harrah's Cherokee Casino on the weekends to play No-Limit Texas Holdem. Sadly, I can't play poker all the time, so when that's the case I'm either playing fighting games (Guilty Gear, JJBA:HFTF) or playing D&D with my friends. I used to do a lot of game development as a hobby as well, but lately haven't really been doing it too much.
