## Background

I was born in Illinois, moved once within the state when I was 9, then moved to Kentucky when I was 13.  
In highschool I played the trumpet in my school's many ensembles, including the competitive marching band, as well as select state-wide groups.

## Interests

I enjoy playing competitive video games, most notably StarCraft 2 in which I am ranked in the top 3% worldwide.  
I occasionally create videos such as [this one](https://youtu.be/cWSPTAhK1YU) that I made for a COSC 317 project.

### I am familiar with:

C++, C#, HTML, CSS, Git, Unity
