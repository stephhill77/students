# About Me
I am a junior computer science student at the University of Tennessee.  I have been interested in cs for a long time and started taking classes in high school.  I am proficient with c++ and python and I am familiar with html, css, and js.  Outside of school I like to hike, workout, read, and hang out with my friends.
