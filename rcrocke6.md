#### Background
I grew up in Mount Juliet, TN, and lived on a boat for a few years. I started programming in middle school after joining a coding club that was using Python, and began to learn web design in my free time.

#### Interests
I like music, video games, coding, traveling, and enjoy playing the guitar and piano. I also like recording music, but I started only recently and everything I record is mediocre at best.
