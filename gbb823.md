Greetings! As stated above, my name is Mason Hyman and I'm from Chattanooga, TN. As with the majority of students in CS340, I am a huge computer nerd. Whether it's development, working with hardware, or piddling in the CLI, I tend to enjoy all things CS. In late elementary school I built my first PC specifically for gaming and ever since that i've been hooked, diving deeper and deeper into the world of the computer in order to learn and be able to do more.

I am primarily familiar with C/C++ in addition to make and many Unix tools that are handy for development.

Outside of the computer, I am strongly addicted to the outdoors and rock climbing. If i'm not sitting at a computer, there is a good chance i'm hanging out on the side of the cliff baking in the warm sun. Below are some of my favorite places to climb:

- Linville Gorge (NC)
- New River Gorge (WV)
- Tennessee Wall (TN)
- Foster Falls (TN)
