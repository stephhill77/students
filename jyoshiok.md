## Background
I was borned and raised in Knoxville, TN. I showed an early interest in computer science, teaching myself how to code at the age of ten. Since then, I have worked on a variety of projects spanning web applications, robotics, computer vision, video-games, and data collection/visualization. I am an aspiring software engineer. So far, I have completed three internships, two at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and one at Microsoft.

## Interests
Outside of my school, I enjoy video-games with friends, go-karting, and aviation. Although most of my experience is in web development, I have a strong passion for robotics. I am also fascinated by autonomous vehicles (big [Tesla](https://tesla.com) fan)!
