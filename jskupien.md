I grew up in Franklin, Tennessee on a cow farm. I started coding in high school after finding out I was allowed to take cs classes instead of math classes, but I ended up developing a huge passion for it, taking every other class my high school had to offer. I have been at UT for two years now and just finished an internship at a [startup AI company](https://fluid-ai.com/). I have many outdoor interests like mountaineering, rock climbing, training for the [Continental Divide Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_Trail), and I am part of the UTK fly fishing club, [Vols on the Fly](https://utk.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/volsonthefly). 

I am most comfortable with the following languages/tools/frameworks:
1. C/C++
2. C#
3. Python (in a machine learning and robotics context)
4. Linux
5. Java/Javascript
6. Bitbucket, Github, Gitlab, Google Collab
7. CAD
